## ðŸ¤– Kollider API Client written in Python ðŸ¤–

Kollider offers both a REST api as well as a Websocket api. Both apis provide the same basic accessor methods, however, account specific events are only available through websockets and historical data is only available through rest. We are working towards making them identical.

You can install the client package in your environment by running.

```
cd kollider-api-client
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: Not all methods have been implemented yet. This is very much a WIP.
